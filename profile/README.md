## Epilogue Remastered Github ‚ò†Ô∏èüíÄ

## Concept
A high end resolution 2d apoloypic end of the world game, where you fight off of enemies and monsters, to gain points for coins and to level up skills and player levels. You can upgrade or buy better guns from a shop menu from a shop npc. At the start there is a introduction scene. You can travel to harder places using a vechile, be warned you may get ambushed while driving so you can upgrade or buy better vechiles or buy body guards that will warn you if there are incoming enemies, they don't attack but run away once see enemies. They will come back to you once you go back to camp.
